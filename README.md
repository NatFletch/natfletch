Hello! My name is Nathan Fletcher and welcome to my Github page!

Here are some projects I've worked on:
## Robotics
*First Robotics Team 1806*

<a href="https://github.com/frc1806/Crescendo-1806">Crescendo-1806</a>: Robot code for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescendo_(FIRST)">2024 FRC Season</a>

<a href="https://github.com/frc1806/ChargedUp-1806">ChargedUp-1806</a>: Robot code for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_Up_(FIRST)">2023 FRC Season</a>

<a href="https://github.com/frc1806/RapidReact-1806">RapidReact-1806</a>: Robot code for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_React">2022 FRC Season</a>

From FIRST Robotics Competition, I learned many skills along the way. Software wise, I learned the importance of object oriented programming, writing efficient code production level code, and applying math to software in real world robotics. Robotics as a whole taught me the engineering design process and how to approach and solve engineering problems with robotics. This club also taught me valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, collaborating with other teams, time management, and much more.

## Future Business Leaders of America

<a href="https://github.com/NatFletch/FBLA-Programming-2023">FBLA-Programming-2023</a>: My submission for FBLA Coding and Programming in 2023. This project won 5th place at the Missouri State Leadership Conference. From there I was given the opportunity to compete at the National Leadership Conference in Atlanta, GA. Although this project did not win awards at the national level, this challenge was monumental for learning software development. I learned how to use SQL databases and write code for a real world scenario.
