## Current Works:
Currently I am just working learning the most amount of coding I can to pursue a professional career over programming. Here are my projects that I started and still working on
 - [FBLA-Programming-2023](https://github.com/NatFletch/FBLA-Programming-2023): A project in FBLA where I have to create an application that tracks my school's attendance at school events such as sports games and assemblies.
 - [22x](https://github.com/frc1806/22x): A FIRST robotics robot that is made by entirely of students where mentors do not dictate that happens much to the design process. This is an offseason project and it is not based off of any specific game.


## Learning:
Right now I plan on increasing my Python skills mainly. I also try to increase C++ and Java skills and eventually want to start learning Javascript so I can learn how to make webpages that aren't static and electron apps.

## Help:
If you wish to help me out I would love to know what kind of learning resources you use to learn new languages, the kinds of libraries you use for `x` functionality, or any code suggestions you would recommend. 

## How to reach me:
